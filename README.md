# icare

**icare** is an automated service designed to streamline patient data processing between a Hospital Information System (SIMRS) and the Indonesian National Health Insurance (BPJS) web portal. It periodically fetches patient data, creates processing jobs, and uses browser automation to submit the data, all while providing a real-time web interface for monitoring.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project, **icare**, is designed to automate specific patient verification tasks within the BPJS web portal. It is developed for **internal operational efficiency, research, and educational purposes**, addressing challenges with manual compliance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **BPJS Policy & Expected Use:** The BPJS iCare process is officially intended for manual execution by medical professionals while accessing relevant patient data. This automation serves to streamline an internal workflow where manual compliance has been challenging, leading to official warnings from BPJS.
* **Potential for Non-Compliance:** While this tool aims to improve internal efficiency, its use of automation for actions expected to be manual may be viewed by BPJS as non-compliant or unusual access. There is a risk of further warnings, or other actions from BPJS.
* **Terms of Service:** Users of this software are responsible for ensuring their usage complies with all current and future terms of service, guidelines, and policies set forth by BPJS Kesehatan.
* **No Guarantees & Risk Assumption:** The author and contributors assume no responsibility for any direct or indirect issues, damages, or consequences arising from the use of this software, including but not limited to:
    * Further reprimands, warnings, or sanctions from BPJS.
    * Disruptions or suspensions of BPJS portal access.
    * Any legal, financial, or operational implications for the organization or patients.
    * Accuracy or integrity of data submitted through automated means.
    * Other unforeseen risks associated with automating external web portals.

**By utilizing this project, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks. It is strongly recommended that this tool be used only within environments where explicit internal authorization has been obtained, and all users understand the potential implications. Ongoing communication with BPJS regarding compliance and integration methods is highly advisable.**

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Patient Processing**: Automatically fetches patient data from a SIMRS database on a configurable schedule.
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Automatically skips job execution on Indonesian public holidays.
- **Browser Automation**: Uses Playwright to reliably automate interactions with the BPJS web portal.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: A web-based UI provides a live dashboard of job statuses (pending, done, failed).
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures that running processes are completed before the application shuts down.
- **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Telegram Notifications**: Sends notifications about job statuses via Telegram.


## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rizkyilhampra/icare-automation
    cd icare-automation
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    This will also install the necessary Playwright browser binaries.

### Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

```ini
# --- Application Configuration ---
# The port on which the application will listen.
PORT=3000

# The timezone for the application. This affects logging and cron job schedules.
# Example: Asia/Jakarta, Europe/London. Refer to IANA Time Zone Database for valid values.
TZ=Asia/Makassar

# Controls whether the browser runs in headless mode (true) or with a visible UI (false).
# Set to 'true' for production environments.
HEADLESS=true

# Maximum number of retries for processing a single job (e.g., patient BPJS verification).
# If a job fails this many times, it will be marked as 'failed' and no further attempts will be made.
MAX_ATTEMPT=3

# Whether application logs should be written to a file in addition to the console.
# Set to 'true' to enable file logging.
LOG_TO_FILE=true

# The current environment of the application (e.g., 'development', 'production', 'test').
# Affects logging levels, error handling, and other environment-specific behaviors.
NODE_ENV=production


# --- Cron Job Schedule ---
# Defines the schedule for cron jobs using standard cron syntax.
# For more information on cron syntax, see: https://crontab.guru/

# Schedule for weekdays (Monday-Friday): Every 10 minutes between 4 PM and 5:59 PM.
# Format: 'minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week'
# '*/10': Every 10 minutes
# '16-17': Between 4 PM and 5 PM (inclusive)
# '* *': Any day of the month, any month
# '1-5': Monday to Friday
WEEKDAY_CRON='*/10 16-17 * * 1-5'

# Schedule for Saturdays: Every 10 minutes between 12 PM and 1:59 PM.
# Format: 'minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week'
# '*/10': Every 10 minutes
# '12-13': Between 12 PM and 1 PM (inclusive)
# '* *': Any day of the month, any month
# '6': Saturday
SATURDAY_CRON='*/10 12-13 * * 6'


# --- Database Configuration (MySQL for SIMRS - Hospital Management Information System) ---
# Connection details for the MySQL database used by the SIMRS application.
SIMRS_DB_HOST=your_simrs_db_host
SIMRS_DB_USER=your_simrs_db_user
SIMRS_DB_PASSWORD=your_simrs_db_password
SIMRS_DB_DATABASE=your_simrs_db_name

## Usage

### Running the Application

-   **Development Mode:**
    The following command starts the application in development mode with hot-reloading powered by `ts-node-dev`.

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

-   **Production Mode:**
    First, build the TypeScript code, then run the compiled JavaScript.
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    pnpm start
    ```

### Running with Docker

For a more production-like environment, you can use Docker Compose:

1.  Ensure your `.env` file is created and configured.
2.  Build and run the container in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
The service will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the `PORT` you specified).

## 🖥️ API Endpoints

The application exposes several endpoints:

-   `GET /`: Serves the main web-based monitoring UI.
-   `GET /health`: Health check endpoint used by Docker to monitor the application's status. Returns `200 OK` if the service is running.
-   `GET /jobs`: Returns a list of all jobs and their current status.
-   `GET /patients`: Returns a list of patients for the current day from the SIMRS database.
-   `GET /events`: A Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint that streams real-time job status summaries to the web UI.
